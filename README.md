About The Dataset
In this project I take The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" is a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset encompasses a wide range of parameters, providing a detailed insight into the demographic and clinical profiles of these individuals.
Included in this dataset are key demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education level, offering a comprehensive overview of the sample population. Additionally, clinical information like the date of OCD diagnosis, duration of symptoms, and any previous psychiatric diagnoses are recorded, providing context to the patients' journeys.

The dataset also delves into the specific nature of OCD symptoms, categorizing them into obsession and compulsion types. Severity of these symptoms is assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores for both obsessions and compulsions. Furthermore, it documents any co-occurring mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety diagnoses.

Notably, the dataset outlines the medications prescribed to patients, offering valuable insights into the treatment approaches employed. It also records whether there is a family history of OCD, shedding light on potential genetic or environmental factors.

Analysis:
After Successfully analyse the data we come up with some insights that are:
1. count the number of Gender (Male & Female) who is suffering in OCD and their obsession score. The females have obsession score (20.20) where as the males have (19.90).
2. Count of Patients by Ethnicity and their respective Average Obsession Score. We find that "Asian" have highest obsession Score. where as "African" have the lowest.
3. Number of people diagnosed with OCD MoM. Here we try to find out in a month how many people diagnosed.
4. We try to find the most common Obsession Type (Count) & it's respective Average Obsession Score. We find that "Hoarding" is on the top and "Religious" is surprisingly low.
5. We try to find out the most common Compulsion type (Count) & it's respective Average Obsession Score. Here we see that "Ordering" is having maximum obsession Score. where as "Washing" is at the bottom of of the list.
